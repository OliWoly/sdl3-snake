# Snake Game
*SDL3 Implementation with C++*

# TODO
Make the grid a tile system.
Each tile should be able to be replaced/hidden by an apple/snake.
Each tile should have its own position, colour, etc. Basically an entity.
Grid should work off of tiles and dynamically remove/hide them when obstructed.
